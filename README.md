## About The Project

<h3>1. MIT App Inventor</h3>

  <p>
    MIT App Inventor is a cloud-based tool, which means you can build apps for Android or iOS devices right in your web browser.This project used MIT App Inventor to develop a system which is "Health Tracking System".
  </p>
  <br />

<h3>2. Health Tracking System</h3>

  <p>
       Health Tracking System is a system that get the data information from user then used the data information to track the users' health. Such as, BMI. It also let the user to be self discipline by the fucntion of "Set & Record Drinks" which is let the user targets the drinks in a period time him/her self. In the system, we have the funtion to let the user view their history of BMI and view the chart that record all the user who used this system.

<!-- Step Implementing -->
## Step for Implementing the App
<h4>Step 1 : Requirements in the project</h4>
<br/>
<p> Based on the guideline of the assignment, all the requirements are described. We followed all the requirements that have to be included in the application and designed our application.</p>
<br/>

<h4>Step 2 : Setup a private GitHub repository</h4>
<br/>
<p>Based on the guideline of the assignment, all of our app documentation must be uploaded to a github repository. As a result, we've formed a private github group to which all project members will be invited, allowing them to easily update their work while also allowing group members to observe it.</p>
<br/>

<h4>Step 3 : Task Distribution</h4>
 <br/>
<p>Our leaders provide responsibilities to each team member in order to establish good team interaction. The list below reveals which members are responsible for which tasks.</p>
<br/>
<ul>
<li>
Feu Che Sung
<ul>
	<li>Register and Login page.</li>
	<li>Health Dashboard</li>
	<li>Help checking other member works.</li>
	<li>Readme.</li>
</ul>

	<li>BMI data sent to Google Sheets.</li>
<li>Usage Manual.</li>
<li>Readme.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<br/>

<h4>Step 4 : Design Interface and Implementation</h4>
<br/>
<p>We designed the interfaces by using the languages HTML and JavaScript in other tools such as Notepad++ and Visual Studio Code. We imported the HTML file into MIT app inventor and added the blocks to complete our application to be fully functional.</p>
<br/>

<h4>Step 5 : Update progress of the project</h4>
<br/>
<p>We used a social media platform such as Google Meet/Wechat as our primary communication tool, and all conversation and progress results were posted in the Wechat group or communicated to the meeting leader. All files exported from MIT App inventor, on the other hand, will be published and shared with other members for progress updates.</p>
<br/>

<h4>Step 6 : Application Testing </h4>
<br><p>After implementing our application, we tested and debug the errors to allow users to use our application more conveniently. In order to provide an effective BMI calculator and health monitor, we tried to fix and minimize the inconvenience parts to get better results.

<!-- tools used to implement -->
## Hardware/Software Tools We Used to Implement the App

<p>
 First tool that we are using is MIT App Inventor. MIT App Inventor is a web application integrated development environment that is maintained by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It's a simple, visual programming environment that lets anyone create fully functional applications for their smartphones and tablets. The second is Notepad++. We used it to code our HTML file for our application interface.

## Middlewares/APIs that We Used to Interconnect Different Software Tools in Our App 

<p>
 We need to install “MIT AI2 Companion” into our smartphone to connect the program that we did in MIT App Inventor.

<!-- techniques -->
## Techniques That Our Team Used to Implement The Version Control On GitHub
<p>The technique that we used to implement the version control on GitHub is by naming the file name. Everytime we update the coding, we will upload the new version by naming it “Version[Num]”. For example, the first coding we uploaded is “Version1.aia”, the second file name will be “Version2.aia” and the further versions are so to be.</p>
